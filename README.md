# scioly-bot

A science olympiad bot in the works. This bot allows you to take event tests automatically, only needing input at the start of every week to set the tests for the week. This bot can easily be adapted to other communities where taking tests/examinations is a crucial part of advancing in the community, only needing a couple of changes in order to function. It is currently very pre-alpha, and I look forward to adding more features such as role auto-detection, and a more fun side to the bot such as a meme of the day being posted to increase the livelihood of the server.
